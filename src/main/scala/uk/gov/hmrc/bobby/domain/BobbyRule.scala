  // In some cases multiple bobby rules are found which may be activated, so we need to prioritise which one is the
  // chosen one.
  // e.g. you might create a rule on reactive mongo 0.17.0 because of a memory leak. Later on you might create a new
  // rule to outlaw all version of reactive mongo.
  // If we now try to use reactivemongo 0.17.0 in our build, both bobby rules apply. In this case, we want to take the
  // second one as it is more encompassing.
  //
  // The priority we apply is below, in decreasing order of precedence:
  // 1. First take the upper bound of the rule version. The one that is the *highest* takes precedence
  //    a. No upper bound (None) first
  //    b. Highest upper bound if both defined
  // 2. Inclusive upper bound over exclusive (when version numbers matching)
  // 3. Most recent rule first
  // 4. Undefined (very much an edge case, pick any)
